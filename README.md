# Typer

*Type faster, innovate smarter.*

A minimalist, highly customizable typing test application built with React and TypeScript. Inspired by the clean aesthetics and focused user experience of modern typing platforms.




## Features

Typer is designed to be a clean, distraction-free, and highly performant typing environment.

### Core Typing Experience
- **Focus Mode**: The header and settings automatically disappear when a test starts, allowing you to focus completely on typing.
- **Smooth Scrolling Text**: The line of words automatically scrolls horizontally to keep the character you are typing centered, creating a seamless and infinite feel.
- **Animated On-Screen Keyboard**: A physical-style keyboard shows which key you're pressing with a satisfying "press down" animation.
- **Instant Reset**: Start a new test at any time by pressing the **`Tab`** key.

### Rich Customization
- **Test Modes**: Choose your preferred test format.
  - **Words**: Test yourself on a specific number of words (10, 25, 50, or 100).
  - **Time**: Test how much you can type in a set duration (15, 30, or 60 seconds).
- **Content Toggles**:
  - **Punctuation**: Add common punctuation and code-like symbols to the word pool for a more realistic challenge.
  - **Challenge Mode**: Test your reading and typing skills by converting the text to a difficult-to-read cursive font.

### Detailed Performance Tracking
- **WPM & Accuracy**: See your final Words Per Minute and Accuracy score on the results screen.
- **Live WPM Graph**: After each test, view a graph of your WPM over the duration of the test to see your performance trends.
- **Advanced Metrics**:
  - **Raw WPM**: Calculates your speed based on all characters typed, including errors.
  - **Consistency**: A percentage score that measures the stability of your typing speed.
